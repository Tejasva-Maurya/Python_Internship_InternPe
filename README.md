# Python Internship Projects - InternPe

This repository contains the projects completed during my Python internship at InternPe. Each project showcases different aspects of Python programming, from game development to utility scripts.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to play the game in the terminal.

**File:** `Task_1_Tic_Tac_Toe_Game.py`

#### Features
- Two-player game
- Validates moves
- Checks for win conditions and draws
- Simple and interactive console interface

### 2. Digital Clock
This project is a digital clock application that displays the current time. It uses the `tkinter` library to create a graphical user interface.

**File:** `Task_2_Clock.py`

#### Features
- Displays current time in hours, minutes, and seconds
- Updates every second
- Graphical user interface using `tkinter`

### 3. Automated System Shutdown
This project is a utility script to schedule an automatic shutdown of the system after a specified time interval.

**File:** `project_shutdown.py`

#### Features
- Schedules system shutdown
- User input for time interval
- Confirmation prompt before shutting down
